          <h3>What Is A Local?</h3>
          <p>
            As previously stated, <strong>Terraform Locals</strong> are named
            values that you can refer to in your configuration. You can use
            local values to simplify your Terraform configuration and avoid
            repetition. It is important to note, that unlike variables found in
            programming languages, Terraform's locals don't change values during
            or between Terraform runs such as plan, apply, or destroy. For this
            reason, you can use locals to give a name to the result of any
            Terraform expression, and re-use that name throughout your
            configuration.
          </p>
          <h3>What Is A Variable?</h3>
          <p>
            The official definition of a Terraform Input Variable is that they
            serve as parameters for a Terraform module, allowing aspects of the
            module to be customized without altering the module's own source
            code, and allowing modules to be shared between different
            configurations. If you are familiar with traditional programming
            languages, these variables can be thought of as being like function
            arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being like function arguments rather than being like traditional
            variables in any programming language is an important distinction.
            As these values will be <em>"injected"</em> (my words) into your
            Terraform, where that value is used. To picture that, and using the
            traditional programming language school of thought, you can think of
            where you are using the variable (like in a module, resource,
            etc...) as the <em>"parameter"</em> and the terraform variable as
            the <em>"argument"</em> that fills the parameter of your function.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you declare variables in the root module of your configuration,
            you can set their values using CLI options, environment variables,
            or the Terraform configuration. When you declare them in child
            modules, the calling module should pass values in the module block.
            This means, that variable name and value in child module, will be
            passed to the parent module, where that value will fill a variable
            with the corresponding name, with the value passed from the child
            module.
          </p>
          <div id="one_line_h3">
            <div style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-right: 8px">
              Local
            </div>
            <div class="vs">vs</div>
            <div style="text-transform: uppercase">Variable</div>
          </div>
          <p>
              The most basic way to think about this, going to back to the
              traditional programming language metaphor, is local values are like a
              function's temporary local variables. For example, like saving off the
              value of something, say the result of a return value of another function,
              into a variable, to use it later in your current function.
          </p>
          <p>
            As previously stated, Terraform's locals don't change values during
            or between Terraform runs such as plan, apply, or destroy. To add,
            <strong
              >unlike input variables, locals are not set directly by users of
              your configuration</strong
            >. So, because of this behavior, you can use locals to give a name
            to the result of any Terraform expression, and re-use that name
            throughout your configuration. by saving the value of an expression
            into a local, you have essentially "saved off" the return value of
            something else, for which unless that local is manually overridden
            or changed later or further down in the Terraform config, you
            will have whatever value that local is holding for the rest of the
            Terraform configuration.
          </p>

          <div class="sub_h3">When To Use</div>
          Use local values only in moderation, in situations where a single
          value or result is used in many places and that value is likely to be
          changed in future. The ability to easily change the value in a central
          place is the key advantage of local values.
