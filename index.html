			<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
			<p>Before becoming a software engineer, I had been working in the Music Business for 5 years, being involved
				on the technical side doing project
				management, data analytics, and development. Before that, I was a semi-pro golfer, professional
				musician, and for a couple years a personal trainer and strength coach.</p>
			<br>

			<p>I am incredibly passionate about what I do, as I get to solve problems every day! During my time in the
				Music Business, I had the pleasure of
				working on a nationally recognized team for innovation and being on the cutting edge of technology in
				the Music Business at <a href="https://www.bmg.com/us/">BMG</a>. After the decision to sharpen my skills and attend Nashville Software School, I picked up contract work, and secured a position as a Full Stack Software Engineer
				at a startup in Nashville, TN called <a href="https://www.rootnote.co/">RootNote</a>. This was a true full
				stack role, where I was responsible for architecting and building features, as well as testing, from the
				planning phase, to back end, to front end, and integrating all with our CI/CD pipeline and deployment
				infrastructure.
			<p>I have had an interest and passion for Cloud, Infrastructure, SRE, and DevOps from the start
			of my programming career, and that coupled with a growing expertise in entire development lifecycle and pipeline led me to stepping into a role as a Site Reliability Engineer at <a
				href="https://getbuilt.com/?utm_term=built%20technologies&utm_campaign=Company&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8929400305&hsa_cam=672683233&hsa_grp=34428080295&hsa_ad=216387600416&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-263662130765&hsa_kw=built%20technologies&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjw28T8BRDbARIsAEOMBczQhIWD35YLeXvvljUlI2w_2M1Mv-46saDYETfYYG2Df-nG1fzMo-8aAokzEALw_wcB">Built
				Technologies</a>. In this role, I was able to lead a small team that would implement SRE principals and metrics, who's focus would be on system availability and reliability in production, as well as quality gate checks and standards, as deliverables moved through different environments.
			</p>
			<p>Currently, I am a DevOps Engineer on the systems and cloud infrastructure team at <a href="https://www.shipt.com/">Shipt</a>, where I utilize my application development
				 and full-stack engineering experience to facilitate and create tooling for developer velocity, as well as my infrastructure and previous SRE experience to create and 
				 manage immutable infrastructure through the DevOps set of guiding principals, standards, and workflows.
			</p>
			<p>Personality wise, I am a lifelong learner and will always consider myself "junior" as there is always
				something new
				to learn, something to improve, and goals to be met. I am self-motivated, productive, accomplished
				individual with a dedication to working towards ambitions. As
				an organized team member, I enjoy working with new people as well as established groups. I am a fast
				learner when it comes to new tasks with strong analytical, planning, and problem solving skills.</p>

						<h3>Quantum Coasters</h3>
						</header>
						<p>As a roller coaster enthusiast, this project exemplifies my <strong>fullstack</strong> skills as a engineer. My goal
							was to build a platform and one-stop shop for roller
							coaster fans and other enthusiasts to track their coaster <a
								href="https://coasterbuzz.com/Forums/Topic/what-exactly-counts-as--a-credit">credits</a>, as well as provide many other options and services.
							Quantum Coasters also
							encompasses a thorough,
							usable, crowd sourced
							API/ Database of roller coaster information and locations, as well as being an interactive
							application where users can view/ record their credits, see a live leaderboard, plan their next theme park visit with the custom
							integrated calendar, read the latest theme park news by accessing the Quantum News, and
							message/ chat with other users either in a public forum, group chat, or private message.</p>

						<p>Quantum Coasters is a <strong>miro-services architected</strong> application with a React
							Client, Django full-stack application, third party Authentication and Management API, and
							Django RESTful API. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used for authentication and
							authorization,
							and is fully integrated across all services Quantum has to offer, allowing for a
							<strong>Federated user</strong> to have a SSO experience. Please see ReadMe on Github for
							more details as well as list of technology used. <em>Django Rest API repo <a

							<h3>EC2 Running Containerized Application</h3>
						</header>
					<p>This project creates an EC2 instance in AWS running a basic web application in Docker using a single command from the user. Before the script is run, there is no EC2 instances running and afterward the script should output the address of your working web application. The single command from the user can (and likely will) call a longer shell script, or other configuration management code. Part of the challenge is to have restricted access, so you can not use to EKS, ECS, S3, ELB, ASG, or Route53.

						<h3>Finding Given IP Address in Subnetwork</h3>
					</header>
					<p> For a description of CIDR notation, and how to find the upper and lower IP range from a
						given CIDR, see <a
							href="https://github.com/MattCrook/CIDR-python-script/blob/main/docs/CIDR.md">Subnetting
							in CIDR Notation</a>. This script can be run as a <strong>Command Line</strong> program,
						in which the program can find the subnet mask of a given IP address that is entered
						to the command line prompt. Or, can also be used the inverse, of having a subnet mask (CIDR)
						and returning the range of IP addresses available to that CIDR. However, it's main goal is
						to return True or False if the given IP that is input is within the range of a given
						subnetwork, retrieved from a list of <a
							href="https://stat.ripe.net/data/country-resource-list/data.json?resource=US&v4_format=prefix">official
							subnetworks</a>. Then, if desired, return the upper and lower ends of the range (Network
						ID and Broadcast ID).</p>
					<p>For more in depth description of the functions used in the logic, and the functionality

						<h3>Python Sockets and Multi Threading</h3>

						other users on the same local IP address, also running the program on the command line. It
						will also show how many connections (i.e other people using the program) there are.

			<h3 class="snippet-title">From project manager, to data analytics manager, to developer.</h3>
			<p>Before becoming a software engineer, I had worked in the music industry as an Income Tracking Services
				Manager and Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.bmg.com/de/">Bertelsmann Music Group</a>, I gained
				experience working in a rapidly
				changing and demanding environment, where my role touched nearly every other department in the company.
				My responsibilities in redirection, live performance tracking, mechanical tracking, radio tracking,
				pipeline analysis and forecasting would contribute to over $5 million dollars recovered annually.
				In addition, I worked regularly with large data in Hadoop, later in GCP, utilized the underlying platform services and
				infrastructure, wrote scripts to fetch data using various API's, developed extensive professional experience in data visualizations using python and Tableau, 
				used of SQL for queries using various drivers and Power BI, and worked directly with our developers to build tools, apps, and automate processes. 
				My deepening curiosity, ambition towards goals, and drive for to always have something new to work towards lead me to attending <a
					href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" alt="NSS Link">Nashville Software School</a>. That
				curiosity and drive did not stop through school, and shorty after graduating from NSS, I accepted a role
				as a full-stack software engineer at <a href="https://www.rootnote.co/">RootNote</a> where I got to help
				build many of analytical and data visualization software I once used. Continuing to learn and with the
				drive to grow my skills and craft, I found I had a passion and deep curiosity towards infrastructure, and I followed this path by becoming an SRE at <a
					href="https://getbuilt.com/">Built Technologies</a>.
				</p> Growing my skillset in both application development and infrastructure, and gaining experience working with large distributed systems, I then moved on to my current role, which is DevOps Engineer on the systems and cloud infrastructure team at <a href="https://www.shipt.com/">Shipt</a>.
